# Smart-Key-Exchange-and-Authentication-scheme
A key exchange and authentication scheme for Fog computing architecture. 
Developed after study and cryptanalysis of SAKA- FC (Secured Authentication and Key Exchange for Fog Computing) by Wjid et al. (published at Springdale library). 
This scheme provides much more efficiency and lesser turn around time than analysed SAKA- FC scheme (Please refer to conclusion of project document).

Contributions are invited :)
